```swift
// Animation Constants
static let quickDuration: TimeInterval = 0.2
static let springResponse: Double = 0.6
static let scalePressed: CGFloat = 0.95

// Layout Constants  
static let largeSpacing: CGFloat = 24
static let deviceIconLargeSize: CGFloat = 80
static let toggleWidth: CGFloat = 60

// Performance Constants
static let maxConcurrentOperations: Int = 5
static let memoryWarningThreshold: Double = 200.0
